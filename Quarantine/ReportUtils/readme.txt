This is code contributed by Andrew Denton. These are units used to
generate listing reports with grouping support.  It was originally
written for tiOPF1 and Report Builder. Since then he has switched
to Fast Report, but with the same reporting interface.

For more details on what this is and how it works, take a look at the
message thread in the tiopf.support newsgroup where he explains it:
