= HOW TO UPGRADE FROM OLDER VERSIONS TO ADOM 4.3 =
==================================================


How to update your old Delphi code
----------------------------------

You can use other ADOM major versions (such as 5.1) 
together with version 4.3, but only one of 
these packages can be an active design package.  In
other words: you cannot mix visual components from 
different ADOM versions in the same project.  
However, you can use multiple ADOM versions in the 
same unit at runtime.  To do so, add the ADOM units 
you want to use to the uses clause of your unit.  
Now, you can use the name of the ADOM units as a 
prefix to refer to the correct class unambiguously, 
e.g. AdomCore_4_3.TdomDocument vs. 
AdomCore_5_1.TdomDocument.

In case you want to completely update all your 
Delphi projects to ADOM 4.3 proceed as follows:

1. First you must uninstall the old components as 
   described below.
2. Install ADOM 4.3 as described in the README.txt 
   file.
3. Reload your projects and remove each reference
   to an earlier ADOM version in the uses clauses 
   of a unit and replace it by a reference to 
   AdomCore_4_3, if that is not done automatically 
   by the Delphi shell.
4. Adjust your source code. For a detailed 
   documentation of all classes see the 'manual.xml'
   file in the 'manual' folder.
   

How to completely uninstall old ADOM components
-----------------------------------------------

1. Choose "Component | Install Packages". 
   A new dialog is launched.
2. Uninstall the old ADOM package by using the 
   Remove button.
3. Close the package window, and next confirm
   that the modifications should be saved. 
4. Delete all old ADOM files (make a backup 
   before, if required).
