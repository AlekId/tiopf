 Using tiOPF with fpGUI Toolkit
 ------------------------------

The GUI support for tiOPF using the fpGUI Toolkit is stored in the fpGUI
repository - not in the tiOPF repository. Many demos have also been ported
using the fpGUI Toolkit and also live in the fpGUI repository.

For more information please see the fpGUI website:
   http://opensoft.homeip.net/fpgui/

tiOPF support is stored in the following fpGUI repository location:
   git clone git://fpgui.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/fpgui/fpgui

then look in the '/extras/tiopf' directory.
